# 🐧 Linux Shell Scripting Guide

This repository contains examples and explanations of Linux shell scripts used for system automation, diagnostics, and configuration. Shell scripting is a powerful way to interact with Unix-like systems directly from the command line.

## 📜 What Is a Shell Script?

A **shell script** is a text file containing a sequence of commands for a Unix-based shell (like `bash`, `sh`, or `zsh`). It automates repetitive tasks, configures systems, and performs complex operations using simple syntax.

Shell scripts are interpreted, not compiled, and run directly in the terminal or via automation tools.

## ✨ Features of Shell Scripts

- ✅ Automate system tasks (backups, updates, monitoring)
- 📦 Manage files and directories
- 📊 Gather system information (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- 🔄 Loop through data and perform batch operations
- 🔐 Handle user input and permissions
- 🧠 Use logic and conditions to make decisions

## 🆚 Shell Script vs Python vs CLI vs Terraform

| Feature               | Shell Script                      | Python Script                     | CLI Tools                         | Terraform                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Language Type        | Interpreted (Bash, Sh)            | Interpreted (Python)              | Binary/Scripted                   | Declarative Configuration         |
| Use Case             | System-level automation           | General-purpose programming       | Command-line utilities            | Infrastructure as Code (IaC)      |
| Portability          | High (on Unix systems)            | High (requires Python interpreter)| Varies by tool                    | Cloud-focused                     |
| Syntax Complexity    | Simple                            | Moderate                          | Tool-specific                     | Declarative, YAML-like            |
| Error Handling       | Basic                             | Advanced                          | Tool-dependent                    | Built-in validation               |
| Integration          | Native to OS                      | Requires interpreter              | Depends on tool                   | Integrates with cloud providers   |

Shell scripts are ideal for quick system tasks, while Python offers more flexibility and libraries. CLI tools are specialized for specific tasks, and Terraform is best for managing infrastructure.

## 🧩 Shell Script Components

To effectively learn and write shell scripts, it's important to understand the following core elements:

- **Variables** – Used to store and manipulate data such as strings, numbers, and file paths.
- **Conditionals** – Enable decision-making using constructs like `if`, `else`, and `elif`.
- **Loops** – Automate repetitive tasks using `for`, `while`, and `until` loops.
- **Functions** – Organize reusable blocks of code for modular and maintainable scripts.
- **Operators** – Perform arithmetic, comparisons, and logical operations.
- **Input/Output** – Handle user input and display output using commands like `read` and `echo`.
- **File Handling** – Create, modify, and manage files and directories within the script.
- **Exit Status & Error Handling** – Use exit codes and traps to manage script reliability and debugging.
- **Comments** – Document your code for clarity and collaboration using `#`.
- **Command Substitution** – Embed the output of commands directly into variables or expressions.
- **Environment Variables** – Access and modify system-level variables like `$PATH`, `$HOME`, etc.
- **Sourcing vs Execution** – Understand the difference between running a script and sourcing it into the current shell session.

These components form the foundation of shell scripting and are essential for building robust, efficient, and portable automation scripts.
